`dpareto` gives the density distribution function. The Paretp distribution density is calculated using the following formula: $$ f(x|\alpha,\beta) = \frac{\beta{\alpha}^\beta}{x^{\beta+1}} $$
for $0<\alpha\leq x$ and $\beta>0$. Note that densities are defined on the entire real line; they are zero outside of the support of the distribution.

**usage**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
dpareto(2:4, 1, 2)
```

## Contribution Statement

Both Alex and Kun wrote their own code of the function first and discuss on the final version.
